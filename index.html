      Hey! My name is Peres Akenteng, and I'm a Computer Science student
      passionate about software Engineering. I have two years of experience
      managing various online campaigns and writing codes for clients across the
      world. I love analyzing consumer behavior and leveraging data-driven
      strategies to maximize ROI. Outside work, I enjoy working out, taking
      funny photos, and exploring new hiking trails.
    </p>
    
      <div id="1">
        <a href="#Major" ><h1>MAJOR AND SKILLS</h1></a>

        On the surface, Peres Akenteng is an accomplished Computer science with
      over 2 years of experience in Software Engineering. Peres always ensures
      the viability of multi-million dollar software portfolios long-term. He is
      so efficient at her job that he considers herself a "software portfolio
      whisperer." Peres has the ability to take unhealthy codes and transform
      them into healthy and thriving ones. Because of his skills, Peres can
      produce productive and long-lasting results for high-level clients. He
      caters to major companies, non-profit organizations, and hospitals. He
      works well with senior corporate executives and can provide consultations
      for international corporations. More than her role as a Software
      Engineering, He is also effective at persuading and influencing
      high-ranking individuals.
    </div>

    <p><div id="2"> His opinions are highly valued, people trust and
      respect his judgments. Peres earned a degree in BS Computer Science back
      in 2023. Through his course, she developed a passionate interest in the
      geopolitics of Southeast Asia. In particular, he focused on topics like
      sustainable development, self-government, and political economy. Before he
      graduated, Peres worked hard to attain her role as a Software Engineering
      for 12 years. Then she spent a year working at the Governor’s Office of
      Engineering and Budget in Illinois. Here, he managed bond deals worth
      billions of dollars while handling the quantitative analysis needs of the
      office too. Peres also contributed to the development of policies and
      writing the legislative language in debt service structure and bond
      issuance areas. For his most recent eight-year tenure as a Software
      Engineering, Samantha had successfully nourished his insatiable passion.
      he did this by conducting research about the investments of emerging codes
      and international natural resources.
      </div></p>
       Peres’s fascination with the
      third-world comes from humanitarian issues as demonstrated by her two
      missions—to Central America and Honduras. Peres plans to continue her
      education by  applying to Public Policy Graduate School for 2023. He wants
      to engage more with influential decision-makers and thought leaders in
      international public policy. He’s open to challenges, conversations, and
      an exchange of ideas from the top players in the financial industry. His
      long-term goal is to become a national-level policy Engineer. He wants to
      use her untiring commitment and drive to bring more dignity and autonomy
      to the citizens of developing countries. After getting a Graduate degree
      in software Engineer, she will start working towards this cause. Peres had
      a lot of significant professional experiences as a software Engineer. He
      created several tools to help his company evaluate operational
      requirements more accurately and improve the forecasting of software. He
      also monitors and assesses the performance of sales groups, evaluates
      market conditions weekly, and examines revenue trends. Apart from this,
      Peres also created a model of software that improved the sales of the
      company's main product by a whopping 125%. She did this by correlating the
      data based on advertising and marketing expenditures. Moreover, Peres
      supervised the transition of the company to a computer-based ordering
      system. This eliminated warehouse downtime and redundancies which, in
      turn, generated over $1.2 million in savings each year. He works closely
      with the company-s executives to come up with budgets through the
      financial analyses.
